## Sky High Spy Remake / Sky High Spyder 
* **PLATFORM**: Windows
* **LANGUAGE**: C++
* **ENVIRONMENT**: Visual Studio

## Why?
Learning C++ is often seen as dry and difficult, partly because the examples used in teaching are usually text-based and uninspiring. PlayBuffer was designed to try and limit the demands of learning C++ while increasing the payoff for the learner by allowing them to make simple, 2D games.
